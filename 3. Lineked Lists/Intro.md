# What is Linked list?
* A linked list is a *linear dynamic* data stucture. 
* The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand. 
* Each node of a linked list is made of of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last nofe has a reference to null. 
* The entry point into a linked list is called  the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the fist node.
