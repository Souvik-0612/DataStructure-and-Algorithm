# What is Linked list?
* A linked list is a *linear dynamic* data stucture. 
* The number of nodes in a list is not fixed and can grow and shrink on demand. 
* Each node of a linked list is made of of two items - the data and a reference to the next node. The last nofe has a reference to null. 
* The entry point into a linked list is called  the head of the list. It should be noted that head is not a separate node, but the reference to the fist node. 

# Linked list as abstract data type
## Main linked list operations:
* Insert: inserts an elements into the list.
* Delete: removes and returns the specific position elements from the list.
## Auxiliary linked list operations:
* Delete list: removes all elements of the list.
* Count: returns the number of elements in the list.
* Find $n^{th}$ node from the end of the list.
